# TOPSECRETPROJECT
Hey guys... It's Eli from Broken Shadow HQ... Anyways, we are working on a secret project, and we need a variety of people to help... None of the files will be uploaded on github for the project. If you are interested, add your name and contact info (doesn't have to be personal email) in the comments of the job you want.

# Guidelines
I need to know that I can trust who I pick, so I will keep in contact for a few days, and see your skill of coding to see if you can help with the project. All of the contributors are able to have a private copy of the finished project, and are free to work on any other Broken Shadow projects if they wish.

# Rules
First things first, if I catch ANYONE lying, or making comments that harass people, they are going to be immediately taken out of the project. Yes, lying about age counts. You can have 3 chances, for making hurtful comments/excessive cursing. 
Writing spam (random keyboard characters) will get you kicked out of the project.
Doing nothing will get you kicked out of the project.
I am pretty strict about what you can do with this project.
I have had an idea, and have had it stolen, and that really hurt.
If at any point you distribute the project without specific permission, you will:

a) be kicked from the project

b) never be able to participate in another Broken Shadow HQ project

# What happens when the project is distributed without permission
If this ever happens, I will get the link to download taken down, and I am already taking precautions. The file is encrypted, so the only thing you can do is contribute. Like I said, the project is secret. However, after the project is released officially, you are free to distribute AS LONG AS you write that the project was from Broken Shadow HQ, and you give the team members credit.

# What after the release?
After the release, I will unencrypt the files, and the crew members will have full access.
