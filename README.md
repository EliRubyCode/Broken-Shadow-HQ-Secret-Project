# Welcome to Broken Shadow HQ's first BIG project.

Hey guys, it's Eli from Broken Shadow HQ. We are currently working on a secret project, and we need a variety of people to help. If you are interested to contribute, comment the following on the task/team page: Your name, age, and email (can be personal, work, hobby, etc. It does not matter as long as it is a real email address we can contact) You MUST be 13+ to help/contribute. Please follow the EXACT layout from the task page.

# Guidelines
I need to know that I can trust who I pick, so I will keep in contact for a few days, and see your skill of coding to see if you can help with the project. All of the contributors are able to have a private copy of the finished project, and are free to work on any other Broken Shadow projects if they wish.

# Rules
First things first, if I catch ANYONE lying, or making comments that harass people, they are going to be immediately taken out of the project. Yes, lying about age counts. You can have 3 chances, for making hurtful comments/excessive cursing. 
Writing spam (random keyboard characters) will get you kicked out of the project.
Doing nothing will get you kicked out of the project.
I am pretty strict about what you can do with this project.
I have had an idea, and have had it stolen, and that really hurt.
If at any point you distribute the project without specific permission, you will:

a) be kicked from the project

b) never be able to participate in another Broken Shadow HQ project

# What if I try to distribute the project, even though it's encrypted, without specific permission?
The punishments for trying to do this is above in rules. You will never encrypt the file, no matter how hard you try. I have made a custom code that ONLY I know how to decrypt, and in this code, every character is unique, and there is no pattern used for the symbols in the code.
